# TODO

- Fix bug: appDetails not storing the total_reviews and total_positive_reviews
- Create a new field on apps and appDetails such that it stores the time when the information was retrieved. This will be used to store the Updated_At fields in both DB Tables
- TODO: Set timezone for values such as valid_to or updated_at
- Write Tests :)
- Del all OLD files (scripts)
- todo later: Create another separate docker container to revalidate app_info if updated_at is greater than 6 months for example
