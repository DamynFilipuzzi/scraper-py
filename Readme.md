# TODO

[x] Fix bug: appDetails not storing the total_reviews and total_positive_reviews
[x] Fix bug: prices storing wrong currency
[] Redo Steam API KEY
[] Create a new field on apps and appDetails such that it stores the time when the information was retrieved. This will be used to store the Updated_At fields in both DB Tables
[] TODO: Set timezone for values such as valid_to or updated_at
[] Write Tests :)
[] Del all OLD files (scripts)
[] todo later: Create another separate docker container to revalidate app_info if updated_at is greater than 6 months for example
